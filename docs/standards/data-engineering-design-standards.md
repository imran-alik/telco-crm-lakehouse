# Data Engineering Design Standards — Telco CRM Lakehouse

> Canonical standard for portfolio-grade DE case studies, pipelines, and repos.  
> Synthesized from production-oriented portfolios ([vishal-bulbule](https://github.com/vishal-bulbule)), ETL case studies ([uber-data-engineering-mage-project](https://github.com/darshilparmar/uber-data-engineering-mage-project)), warehouse layering ([Retail_Analysis_Redshift](https://github.com/ansamAY/Retail_Analysis_Redshift)), practice repos ([danielbeach/data-engineering-practice](https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice)), and curated lists ([igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering](http://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering)).

Companion pattern catalog: [`design-patterns.md`](./design-patterns.md).

## 1. Purpose

A data engineering deliverable is **not** a script dump. It is a **reproducible system** that:

1. States a business problem a non-engineer understands.
2. Maps every requirement to code, tests, and measurable output.
3. Survives replay, partial failure, and reviewer scrutiny.
4. Documents what is proven locally vs what is scale-out design only.

Use this document when authoring `README.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `SOLUTION.md`, and evidence artifacts.

## 3. README structure (explanatory design entry point)

README is the **front door**. A reviewer should never hunt for the problem statement.

### 3.1 Mandatory sections

1. **Title + domain** — `{Use case} | {Pattern} on {Cloud}` (portfolio front door)
2. **Tech stack table** — layer × local tool × production analogue
3. **Pipeline outcomes** — **committed stats from certification JSON** (ingest fidelity, funnel, triggers, at-risk revenue, DLQ, replay stability, tests, duration)
4. **Architecture diagram** — Mermaid with **module paths**, not generic boxes
5. **Data model overview** — bronze / state / evidence / DLQ layers with grain and keys
6. **Pipeline scripts** — linked extract / transform / load / analytics / certify modules
7. **Getting started** — numbered install → certify → test with pass criteria
8. **Dataset attribution** — source URL, dictionary, committed sample stats
9. **Project structure** — annotated tree
10. **Production roadmap** — honest Proven vs Documented vs Planned
11. **Design deep-dive links** — `DESIGN.md`, `SOLUTION.md`, `CONNECTIVITY.md`, evidence index
12. **References** — portfolio repos that informed structure

See [`design-patterns.md`](./design-patterns.md) §1 for layout examples.

### 3.2 README must not

- Bury pipeline outcomes inside `data/evidence/` without a summary table on README.
- Use tutorial/BTS language (“plug and play”, “simple”, “dive into”, “layman only”).
- Claim cloud scale as “implemented” when only documented.
- Omit how to verify success (exit codes, row counts, gate names).
- Lead with folder tree before tech stack and outcomes.

---

## 4. Design document (`docs/DESIGN.md`) contract

Every design doc MUST include the sections below. Missing any section = **not merge-ready**.

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Pipeline outcomes** | Committed certification stats (rows, funnel, triggers, revenue, replay) |
| 0b | **Metadata** | Status, code root, data roots, entry points, certification script, date |
| 1 | **Verdicts** | Requirement × Proven / Documented / Not started × proof pointer |
| 2 | **Problem statement** | Business + technical problem |
| 3 | **Ask register** | Numbered asks (A1…An) |
| 4 | **Sources & sinks** | Paths, grain, write mode, idempotency keys |
| 5 | **Schemas** | Tables/columns/types; link to schemas |
| 6 | **Lineage & data flow** | Mermaid diagram + per-node failure behavior |
| 7 | **Per-ask implementation** | ASK → SOLUTION → CODE → EXPECTED OUTPUT for each ask |
| 8 | **Conn / disconnect matrix** | Upstream/downstream dependency × connect strategy × failure |
| 9 | **Data evolution** | Schema versioning, backward compatibility, migration notes |
| 10 | **Failure matrix** | Failure mode × behavior × recovery × owner module |
| 11 | **Fallback & resilience** | DLQ, retry, checkpoint, dedupe, graceful degradation |
| 12 | **Feedback loops** | Tests, certification gates, evidence JSON, logging |
| 13 | **Test plan** | Unit / integration / certification commands |
| 14 | **Module map** | Package tree with single responsibility per folder |
| 15 | **Scale / SLA** | Local vs production targets (honest) |
| 16 | **Document control** | Version table |

---

## 5. Code fashion & modularity

Inspired by exercise-style repos (single concern per folder) and production pipelines.

### 5.1 Package layout pattern

```
codebase/telco_lakehouse/
  config/          # dataclass settings, env loading — no hardcoded secrets
  schemas/         # Pydantic/Avro contracts
  ingestion/       # readers, streamers, checkpoints (internal)
  warehouse/       # medallion bronze/silver/gold loaders
  quality/         # DLQ, expectations, validators
  analytics/       # KPI SQL, aggregations
  evidence/        # run summary writers
  orchestration/   # pipeline coordinator only — thin wiring
codebase/scripts/  # CLI entrypoints only
tests/             # mirror behavioral contracts, not file tree
data/source/       # committed samples + attribution
data/evidence/     # committed certification outputs
data/sink/         # gitignored runtime
docs/              # design + connectivity + standards
```

### 5.2 Code rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Idempotent sinks** | At-least-once sources require deterministic keys + UPSERT/MERGE |
| **Config dataclass** | `@dataclass` or Pydantic Settings — not scattered constants |
| **Explicit logging** | `logging` with tags (`[TRIGGER]`, `[DLQ]`) — not print-only |
| **Fail open vs closed** | Document per node: invalid row → DLQ (continue) vs missing source → fail fast |
| **No notebook core logic** | Notebooks for exploration only; production path in importable modules |
| **Single orchestrator** | Business rules in orchestrator; I/O in adapters |
| **Typed contracts** | Pydantic (or equivalent) at system boundary |

### 5.3 Modularity gates

- [ ] Each folder has one reason to change.
- [ ] Orchestrator < 200 lines of domain logic (delegate to adapters).
- [ ] No circular imports between ingestion ↔ warehouse.
- [ ] Tests can run without network (committed sample data).
- [ ] Scripts are thin wrappers calling package APIs.

### 5.4 Library maintenance & dependency catalog

Every repo MUST document **where each library comes from** and how to maintain it in `docs/LIBRARIES.md`.

---

## 6. Testing & quality pyramid

| Layer | Tool | Scope | Must prove |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | pytest | pure functions (idempotency keys, validators) | deterministic behavior |
| **Integration** | pytest + tmp_path | pipeline slices on sample/synthetic | row counts, triggers, DLQ |
| **Certification** | subprocess script | full public sample + quality gates | evidence JSON, exit 0 |
| **Lint** | ruff | style, imports, common bugs | CI green |

---

## 7. Diagrams & graphs

Minimum diagram set:

| Diagram | Type | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `flowchart TB` | README |
| Data lineage | `flowchart LR` | DESIGN.md |

Diagrams must label **modules** (`orchestration/pipeline.py`), not vague boxes.

---

## 8. Feedback, fallback, and operations

### 8.1 Feedback loops

| Loop | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Developer | pytest + ruff locally |
| CI | GitHub Actions on PR |
| Reviewer | evidence JSON + quality_gates booleans |
| Runtime | structured logs + DLQ artifacts |

### 8.2 Fallback patterns

| Pattern | When |
|---|---|
| **DLQ quarantine** | poison messages / schema violations |
| **UPSERT idempotency** | duplicate delivery / replay |

Document explicitly what is **not** implemented (e.g. no Kafka/Airflow yet) vs emulated locally.

---

## 9. Changelog discipline

Use `CHANGELOG.md` with sections: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Security`.

- Every merge-worthy PR updates CHANGELOG under `## [Unreleased]` or a dated version.
- Link changelog entries to asks (A1...A8) when behavior changes.
- Certification evidence refreshed when gates or row counts change.

---

## 10. Git & branching (data engineers)

Pragmatic workflow:

| Practice | Standard |
|---|---|
| Branch | `feature/<short-name>` or `docs/<short-name>` off `main` |
| Commits | Imperative subject; body explains **why** |
| PR | Links DESIGN verdict + test output |
| Never | Force-push `main`, commit secrets, commit `data/sink/` runtime |
| Always | Regenerate evidence when pipeline logic changes |

---

## 11. Tooling categories checklist (from awesome lists)

| Category | Example tools | This repo (telco CRM) |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | Kafka, Pub/Sub, HTTP, CSV | CSV Ingestion & Pydantic Validation |
| Processing | Flink, Dataflow, custom | Python Orchestrator |
| Warehouse | BigQuery, DuckDB, Snowflake | DuckDB Medallion Lakehouse |
| Quality | Great Expectations, DLQ | Pydantic + DLQ JSON |
| Orchestration | Airflow, Dagster | CLI scripts |
| Evidence | dbt tests, custom JSON | certify_public_run.py |

---

## 12. Portfolio verdict rubric

| Grade | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **A — Portfolio ready** | All required artifacts, certification green, CONNECTIVITY complete, CHANGELOG current |
| **B — Engineering sound** | Code + tests pass; docs missing connectivity or changelog |
| **C — Demo only** | Runs locally; no evidence, vague README, no failure matrix |
| **F — Misleading** | Claims production scale without proof; random IDs; no idempotency |
